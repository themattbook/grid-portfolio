						I&apos;m a <strong>fullstack engineer</strong> with a
						passion for building dynamic web applications. I can
						work with your company as a <strong>full time</strong>{" "}
						developer or contract consultant. I bring to the table{" "}
						<strong>expertise</strong> on React, Vue, Sass,
						Tailwindcss, and API design.

						Opensource Social Network

					, a social media framework built on PHP and a co-owner of{" "}

						OpenTeknik

					, the company who owns OSSN. I also completed an 8 month

					<a href='https://www.dfnfreight.com/' target='_blank'>
						DFN Freight Network
					</a>
					, where I joined as the sole developer working directly with
					the CTO on building a Vue 3 application handling logistics
					for carriers and shippers. We eventually hired more
					developers, but for a while there it was ðŸŽµ just the two of
					us ðŸŽµ.
				</p>
				<p>
					I&apos;m extremely flexible. If you need a full-time
					developer, I can do that. If you need a consultant to take a
					look at the project and determine what you need, I can do
					that too. Just need a quick contractor, say less. If
					it&apos;s Javascript or TypeScript, let&apos;s chat.
