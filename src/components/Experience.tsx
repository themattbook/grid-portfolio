				, where I joined as the sole developer working directly with the
				CTO on building a Vue 3 application handling logistics for

				for a while there it was just us two.

				I&apos;m available in a flexible amount of ways. If you need a
				full-time developer, I can do that. If you need a consultant to
				take a look at the project and determine what you need, I can do
				that too. If it&apos;s Javascript or TypeScript, let&apos;s
				chat.
